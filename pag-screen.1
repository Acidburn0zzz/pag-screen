.SH NAME
pag-screen \- run screen session with persistent tickets and tokens
.SH SYNOPSIS
pag-screen [-d] [-S \fIsessionname\fR] [-c \fIfile\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IR pag-screen
allows running long-running programs in a
.B screen
session, in such a way
that the user can disconnect and reconnect without destroying their tickets
or tokens on logout.

.TP
\fB\-d\fR
create a DIR cache (which allows storing multiple sets of Kerberos tickets) instead of a FILE cache. A DIR cache will be created regardless of this option if the current cache is a DIR cache.

.TP
\fB\-S\fR \fIsessionname\fR
specify a name for the session (by default, "pag"). This option is passed to screen.

.TP
\fB\-c\fR \fIfile\fR
use \fIfile\fR instead of "$HOME/.screenrc" as the screen configuration file. This option is passed to screen.

.SH FILES
.TP
/tmp/krb5cc_${USER}_screen_XXXXXXXX (where XXXXXXXX is a random string)
The new Kerberos ticket cache generated by the script.
